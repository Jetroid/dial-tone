<To>: With what?
Caller: Apparently you're good with electronics?
<To>: I guess. Why?
Caller: Could you fix something for me in the next couple days?

<To>: I really can't talk right now.
Caller: Oh... I'm sorry
<To>: Don't be, it's not your fault. I'm organising something important.
Caller: That sounds interesting.
<To>: Viva la revolucion.
Caller: Is that some kind of joke?

<To>: Hi.
Caller: Hey what's up? Your message sounded urgent.
<To>: Yeah. I need you to look after my mum.
Caller: ... What? Why?
<To>: I don't think I'll be able to stay in the country.
Caller: Are you being deported!? What did you do?
<To>: Don't ask why, just... Please.
Caller: Okay. Be safe.

Caller: You asked me to call you?
<To>: Yeah. Can you keep a secret?
Caller: I suppose.
<To>: Do you want to change this country?
Caller: What are you implying?
<To>: I'm part of a group. We need talented people.
Caller: ... The resistance?
<To>: Shut up, don't be so blatant over the phone. You've ruined it.
Caller: No wait!
***
<To>: Hey
Caller: What's so urgent?
<To>: Just got some cool news.
Caller: Okay?
<To>: Guess who's part of the resistance?
Caller: ... You're joking.
<To>: Nope! They have me doing my first job today.
Caller: And you're just talking about it openly over the phone.
<To>: Errrr
Caller: Wow you're dumb. I'm not gonna bail you out of prison, idiot.

<To>: Hello?

<To>: Hello? Is this HQ? Do you have more orders?
...
<To>: Please, I swear I'm loyal. Viva la revolucion.

Caller: Hey, my phone was muted... Revolution?
<To>: Errrrr, it's a funny joke.
<To>: @#!&
***
<To>: Hey, <To> speaking
Caller: Hi hi. What are you doing tonight?
<To>: I shouldn't really talk about it
Caller: Huh? What does that mean?
<To>: It's very sensitive
Caller: That's weird...
<To>: It'll be obvious later
<To>: Watch the news
***
Caller: Hi <To>, do you want to meet up later?
<To>: Yeah we definitely should, my house is empty.
Caller: Amazing. I was wondering...
<To>: Yeah?
Caller: Should we do this over the phone? What if someone listens.
<To>: Good point, they do listen. My friends told me.
Caller: Your friends?
<To>: You don't know them, but they say the government listens to our calls.
<To>: Hopefully they'll fix that soon, maybe even tonight.
Caller: ... What does that mean?
<To>: I'll come meet you.
