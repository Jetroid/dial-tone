Oh, it's you. About time you showed up. Take this switchboard, as an operator it's your job to talk to callers. When you see the a bulb glowing, wire it's plug up to your telephone, see what they want, then plug the wire to their destination. When the bulb shuts off, unplug the wire. I'll get angry if I see a messy switchboard. Look, it's your first call.
